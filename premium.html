      <h1>Uplink Premium</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">One purchase. Yours forever. No subscriptions, no recurring fees.</p>

      <h2>What's Free</h2>
      <p>Uplink is fully functional out of the box. The free tier includes everything you need for day-to-day AI chat:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Text chat</strong> — Full-featured chat with streaming responses, markdown rendering, and conversation history</li>
        <li><strong>Satellites</strong> — Independent conversation threads with isolated context</li>
        <li><strong>File uploads</strong> — Drag-and-drop images, PDFs, and documents</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption</strong> — AES-256 end-to-end encryption for your conversations</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-device access</strong> — Use Uplink from your phone, tablet, or any device on your network</li>
        <li><strong>PWA support</strong> — Install as an app on mobile or desktop</li>
        <li><strong>Push notifications</strong> — Get alerted when new messages arrive</li>
        <li><strong>Midnight theme</strong> — The default dark theme is always available</li>
        <li><strong>All updates</strong> — Free users always get the latest version</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You never need to pay to have a great AI chat experience. Uplink is designed to be useful and complete at the free tier.</p>

      <h2>What's in Premium</h2>
      <p>Premium unlocks advanced features that go beyond the basics:</p>

      <h3>🎙️ Voice Chat</h3>
      <p>Talk to your AI instead of typing. Includes all three voice modes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Push-to-talk</strong> — Hold to record, release to send</li>
        <li><strong>Live Voice</strong> — Real-time voice conversation via OpenAI</li>
        <li><strong>Agent Voice</strong> — Full voice bridge to your OpenClaw agent with tools, memory, and interrupts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Supports all TTS providers (ElevenLabs, OpenAI TTS, Edge TTS, Piper, XTTS) and all STT providers (OpenAI Whisper, Groq, faster-whisper, Browser).</p>

      <h3>🎨 All Themes + Custom Generator</h3>
      <p>Unlock every built-in theme — Midnight, Daylight, Ember, Forest, and Phantom — plus the custom theme generator to create your own. Free users get Midnight only.</p>

      <h3>🤖 Agent Management</h3>
      <p>Access the Agents panel to manage AI agent sessions, routing, and configuration directly from Uplink. Control how OpenClaw routes requests and configure agent-specific behavior.</p>

      <h3>🪟 Split View</h3>
      <p>Open multiple conversations side by side. Compare responses, reference earlier chats while writing, or keep a reference conversation open while working in another.</p>

      <h3>🚀 Early Access</h3>
      <p>Premium users get new features first, including upcoming features still in development.</p>

      <h2>"Coming Soon" — What Does That Mean?</h2>
      <p>If you see <strong>"Premium · Coming Soon"</strong> when you tap a locked feature, it means Premium is real and these features exist in the app — but the purchase flow isn't live yet. We're putting the finishing touches on the storefront.</p>
      <p>When it goes live, you'll be able to purchase directly. In the meantime, if you have a license key (from early access, beta testing, or a promo), you can activate it right now in <strong>Settings → Premium → Enter Key</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Pricing</h2>
      <p><strong>$5 — one time. That's it.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>No subscription</li>
        <li>No monthly fees</li>
        <li>No annual renewal</li>
        <li>No "1 year of updates" expiration</li>
        <li>You pay once and own it forever</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We believe you shouldn't pay a recurring fee for a frontend when you're already paying for API keys. Uplink Premium is a one-time purchase that never expires.</p>

      <h2>How to Purchase</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Click any <strong>"Upgrade to Premium"</strong> button in Uplink (they appear when you try to use a Premium feature), or go to <strong>Settings → Premium</strong></li>
        <li>You'll be taken to our store page</li>
        <li>Complete the purchase ($5, one-time)</li>
        <li>You'll receive a license key via email</li>
        <li>Enter the key in <strong>Settings → Premium → Enter Key</strong></li>
        <li>Done — all Premium features unlock immediately</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Activating Your License</h2>

      <h3>Enter your key</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Open <strong>Settings</strong> (gear icon in the header)</li>
        <li>Scroll to the <strong>Premium</strong> section (or expand it if collapsed)</li>
        <li>Click <strong>"I already have a key"</strong> or <strong>"Enter Key"</strong></li>
        <li>Paste your license key — it looks like: <code>UPL-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX</code></li>
        <li>Click <strong>Activate</strong></li>
        <li>You'll see a confirmation: "✓ Premium activated!"</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Key format</h3>
      <p>Your license key follows this format:</p>

      <div class="code-block">
        <div class="code-block-header">
          <span>text</span>
          <button class="copy-btn">Copy</button>
        </div>
        <pre><code>UPL-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX</code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>Each group is 5 characters — letters and numbers. The key is validated locally on your machine (no internet required for validation after initial activation).</p>

      <h3>3-Device Limit</h3>
      <p>Each license key can be activated on up to <strong>3 devices</strong>. This covers most people — your desktop, your laptop, and your phone, for example.</p>
      <p>If you need to move your license to a different device, <strong>deactivate</strong> it on the old device first (Settings → Premium → Deactivate), then activate on the new one. Deactivation frees up the slot immediately.</p>

      <h3>Deactivating</h3>
      <p>To remove Premium from a device:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <strong>Settings → Premium</strong></li>
        <li>Click <strong>Deactivate</strong></li>
        <li>Confirm when prompted</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Your key isn't lost — you can re-enter it anytime to reactivate. Deactivating just frees up a device slot.</p>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <h3>What happens if I reinstall Uplink?</h3>
      <p>You'll need to re-enter your license key. The key itself never expires — just paste it again in Settings → Premium.</p>

      <h3>Do I need internet to use Premium features?</h3>
      <p>No. Once activated, Premium features work offline. The license is validated locally — no phone-home, no online checks.</p>

      <h3>Can I share my key?</h3>
      <p>Your key works on up to 3 devices. It's meant for your personal devices (desktop, laptop, phone). Sharing with others isn't supported — each person needs their own key.</p>

      <h3>What if I lose my key?</h3>
      <p>Check your email — the key was sent to you when you purchased. If you can't find it, contact us and we'll help you recover it.</p>

      <h3>Will the price go up?</h3>
      <p>The introductory price may increase as more features are added. But if you buy now, you own it at the price you paid — no retroactive changes, ever.</p>

      <h3>Is this really one-time? No hidden fees?</h3>
      <p>Really one-time. No hidden fees, no upsells, no "premium plus" tier coming later. You get everything listed above, and every update, forever.</p>

      <h2>What You're Supporting</h2>
      <p>Uplink is built by a small team. Your $5 goes directly toward development — new features, bug fixes, and keeping the project alive. We chose one-time pricing because we think it's the right thing to do. You already pay for API keys. We don't want to stack another subscription on top of that.</p>
      <p>Thank you for supporting independent software. 💙</p>
