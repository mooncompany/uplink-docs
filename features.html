      <h1>Features Overview</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">Everything Uplink can do — powered by OpenClaw, controlled by you.</p>

      <h2>Built on OpenClaw</h2>
      <p>Uplink is designed as a frontend for <a href="https://openclaw.ai" target="_blank">OpenClaw</a> — the open-source AI agent platform. Every feature in Uplink leverages OpenClaw's capabilities under the hood:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Chat & streaming</strong> — Powered by OpenClaw's gateway API (OpenAI-compatible)</li>
        <li><strong>Satellites</strong> — Uplink's multi-provider switching maps directly to OpenClaw's model routing</li>
        <li><strong>Session persistence</strong> — Your conversation history lives in OpenClaw's session store, surviving restarts and device switches</li>
        <li><strong>Context tracking</strong> — The token counter in the header reads real-time context usage from OpenClaw's session data</li>
        <li><strong>Gateway proxy</strong> — Uplink proxies WebSocket connections directly to OpenClaw for real-time streaming</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Local-First Architecture</h2>
      <p>Uplink runs as a Node.js server on <code>localhost:3456</code>. Your conversations, settings, and data live on your machine. The AI connection goes through the OpenClaw gateway running locally, so your prompts and responses never touch third-party servers unless you explicitly configure an external endpoint.</p>
      <p>When your internet goes down, Uplink keeps serving. The web UI, settings, and conversation history are all local. Only the AI inference requires a working gateway connection.</p>

      <h2>Text Chat</h2>
      <p>The core experience. A clean, responsive chat interface in your browser. Features include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Streaming responses</strong> — Tokens appear in real-time as the AI generates them</li>
        <li><strong>Markdown rendering</strong> — Code blocks, tables, lists, and inline formatting</li>
        <li><strong>Conversation history</strong> — All chats are persisted and searchable</li>
        <li><strong>System prompts</strong> — Set per-conversation or global personality/instructions</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-device sync</strong> — Open the same Uplink instance from any device on your network</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Satellites</h2>
      <p>Satellites are OpenClaw's embed and widget system — they allow you to embed Uplink chat interfaces into other pages or run multiple independent sessions. Each satellite maps to an OpenClaw satellite instance with its own context and configuration.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Embeddable widgets</strong> — Embed Uplink chat into external pages or applications via the satellite system</li>
        <li><strong>Independent sessions</strong> — Each satellite has its own message history and context window</li>
        <li><strong>Create and switch freely</strong> — Spin up new satellites and jump between them from the satellite switcher in the header</li>
        <li><strong>Isolated context</strong> — Starting a new satellite gives you a clean slate without losing your other conversations</li>
        <li><strong>Same gateway</strong> — All satellites route through your single OpenClaw gateway — they're separate sessions, not separate AI providers</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>ℹ Satellites ≠ Providers</strong>
        Satellites are session-level separation, not model-level. They all use the same OpenClaw gateway and whatever model it's configured with. They're part of OpenClaw's embed/widget architecture.
      </div>

      <h2>Activity Panel</h2>
      <p>The activity panel gives you a real-time window into what OpenClaw is doing under the hood. Toggle it with the wrench icon (<strong>🔧</strong>) in the header to see live developer and debug information as your conversation flows.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Tool calls</strong> — See which tools OpenClaw invokes and their results</li>
        <li><strong>API requests</strong> — Watch gateway requests and responses in real-time</li>
        <li><strong>Processing activity</strong> — Follow the AI's work as it streams, reasons, and executes</li>
        <li><strong>Errors and warnings</strong> — Surface issues immediately instead of wondering why something failed</li>
        <li><strong>Toggle on/off</strong> — Click the wrench icon in the header to show or hide the panel at any time</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>💡 When to use it</strong>
        The activity panel is especially useful when debugging tool failures, monitoring long-running tasks, or just satisfying your curiosity about how OpenClaw processes your requests.
      </div>

      <h2>Voice Chat</h2>
      <p>Talk to your AI instead of typing. Uplink supports multiple TTS and STT engines — from free cloud services to fully local GPU-accelerated models. See the <a href="voice-chat.html">Voice Chat</a> page for full details.</p>

      <div class="table-wrap">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Engine</th><th>Type</th><th>Runs Where</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td><strong>ElevenLabs</strong></td><td>Text-to-Speech</td><td>Cloud</td><td>Highest quality, API key required</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>OpenAI TTS</strong></td><td>Text-to-Speech</td><td>Cloud (paid)</td><td>High quality, requires API key</td></tr>

      <h2>End-to-End Encryption</h2>
      <p>Uplink supports optional AES-256 encryption for all conversations. Enable it on first run or later in Settings → Privacy. When enabled:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All messages are encrypted at rest on the server</li>
        <li>Your encryption password never leaves your browser</li>
        <li>Zero-knowledge design — the server cannot read your messages</li>
        <li>If you forget your password, conversations are unrecoverable (by design)</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>ℹ How It Works</strong>
        Your password is used to derive an AES-256 key via PBKDF2 in the browser. Messages are encrypted client-side before being sent to the server. The server only ever sees ciphertext.
      </div>

      <h2>Themes</h2>
      <p>Five built-in themes to match your vibe. Switch instantly in Settings → General. See the <a href="themes.html">Themes</a> page for previews.</p>

      <div class="table-wrap">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Theme</th><th>Accent Color</th><th>Style</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td><strong>Midnight</strong></td><td>Cyan (#00f0ff)</td><td>Dark — the default</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Daylight</strong></td><td>Washed Red (#c84b4b)</td><td>Light</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Ember</strong></td><td>Amber (#f48c06)</td><td>Deep fire, dark navy bg (#03071e)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Forest</strong></td><td>Sage (#a3b18a)</td><td>Earthy dark, dark green bg (#131813)</td></tr>
            <tr><td><strong>Phantom</strong></td><td>Gray (#a0a0a0)</td><td>Monochrome grayscale</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h2>PWA Support</h2>
      <p>Uplink is a Progressive Web App. On mobile, add it to your home screen for a native-app experience — full-screen, no browser chrome, offline-capable UI. Works on both iOS Safari and Android Chrome.</p>

      <h2>Multi-Device Access</h2>
      <p>Since Uplink is a web server, any device on your network can access it by navigating to the server's IP and port. Conversations sync in real-time via WebSocket. Use it on your desktop, laptop, phone, and tablet simultaneously.</p>
      <p>For access outside your home network, see <a href="remote-access.html">Remote Access</a>.</p>

      <h2>OpenClaw Gateway</h2>
      <p>Uplink connects to AI exclusively through the <strong>OpenClaw gateway</strong>. OpenClaw provides an OpenAI-compatible API that handles model routing, session management, and streaming — Uplink is built to take full advantage of these features.</p>
      
      <div class="callout">
        <strong>💡 Why OpenClaw?</strong>
        OpenClaw isn't just an API proxy — it's an AI agent platform with session memory, multi-model routing (satellites), tool execution, and more. Uplink is built to surface all of this through a clean chat interface. Features like the satellite switcher, context tracker, and persistent conversations all depend on OpenClaw's session architecture.
      </div>

      <div class="callout warning">
        <strong>⚠ Other endpoints</strong>
        While the API format is OpenAI-compatible, pointing Uplink at a raw OpenAI endpoint, llama.cpp, or LM Studio will give you basic chat only. Features like satellites, session persistence, context tracking, and gateway status won't work without OpenClaw.
      </div>

      <h2>Agents Panel</h2>
      <p>The Agents Panel lets you manage AI agent sessions, routing, and configuration directly from the Uplink interface. Access it to control how OpenClaw routes requests and configure agent-specific behavior.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Session management</strong> — View and manage active agent sessions</li>
        <li><strong>Routing configuration</strong> — Control how requests are routed between different agents</li>
        <li><strong>Agent settings</strong> — Configure agent-specific parameters and behavior</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>File Uploads</h2>
      <p>Attach files directly to your messages for the AI to analyze. Uplink supports images, documents, and spreadsheets.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Images</strong> — Upload and attach images for vision-capable models to analyze</li>
        <li><strong>Documents</strong> — Attach PDF and DOCX files for content extraction and discussion</li>
        <li><strong>Spreadsheets</strong> — Upload Excel files for data analysis</li>
        <li><strong>Drag and drop</strong> — Drop files directly into the chat input area</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Push Notifications</h2>
      <p>Stay informed even when Uplink isn't in the foreground. Web push notifications alert you when new messages arrive — useful when running long tasks or waiting for agent responses.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Browser push alerts</strong> — Get notified of new messages via your browser's notification system</li>
        <li><strong>Works in background</strong> — Receive alerts even when the Uplink tab isn't active</li>
        <li><strong>Configurable</strong> — Enable or disable in Settings → Notifications</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Missed Messages</h2>
      <p>Never lose track of messages received while you were away. The missed messages system queues messages that arrived while you were offline and lets you catch up when you return.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Offline queue</strong> — Messages received while you're disconnected are queued for later</li>
        <li><strong>Catch-up view</strong> — Review all missed messages when you reconnect</li>
        <li><strong>No data loss</strong> — Messages are persisted server-side until delivered</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conversation Sharing</h2>
      <p>Generate public share links for your conversations. Useful for sharing interesting AI interactions, debugging sessions, or collaborative work with others.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Share links</strong> — Generate a public URL for any conversation</li>
        <li><strong>Read-only access</strong> — Shared conversations are viewable but not editable</li>
        <li><strong>Selective sharing</strong> — Choose which conversations to share</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Keyboard Shortcuts</h2>
      <p>Power users can navigate Uplink efficiently with keyboard shortcuts for common actions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Quick navigation</strong> — Switch between satellites, toggle panels, and access settings without reaching for the mouse</li>
        <li><strong>Chat controls</strong> — Send messages, clear input, and manage conversations with key combos</li>
        <li><strong>Discoverable</strong> — View all available shortcuts from the keyboard shortcuts panel</li>
      </ul>
